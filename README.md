Pol-O is a napari plug-in in development for the processing and analysis of polarised light microscopy datasets. Specifically, Pol-O identifies regions of aligned (i.e. the same orientation angle) birefringent material.


This repository contains jupyter notebooks relevant to the development of Pol-O and tutorial notebooks of how to use it purely in a python environment.
